# QuadrigaCX bitcoin.tax importer

Quadriga API exporter to Bitcoin.tax csv format


## Use at your own risk

This is just a best attempt at creating an exporter. It may or may not contain bugs, so please verify the data that is imported.


## Instructions

Run the following code in a terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/bbondy/quadrigacx-bitcoin.tax
cd quadrigacx-bitcoin.tax
npm install
node .
```

It will write out a file `quadriga.csv`.
Upload that file to bitcoin.tax csv format.

Verify that the data is correct, and please either fix any issues you see or email me at bbondy@gmail.com for help.

This is not tested yet so use at your own risk!
